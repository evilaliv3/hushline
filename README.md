# ü§´ Hush Line

[Hush Line](https://hushline.app) is the first open-source whistleblowing suite for organizations or individuals. It's intended for journalists and newsrooms to offer a public tip line, by educators and school administrators to provide students with a safe way to report potentially sensitive information, or for executives and Board rooms for anonymous employee reporting.

Hush Line meets users where they are by offering a variety of products that meet your security needs:

- **Hush Line managed service** is for anyone who needs an effortless tip line. Just create an account. Tor-ready.
- **Personal Server** is a custom-designed hardware device that runs a Tor-only version of the Hush Line platform.
- **Single-tenant instances** are for customers who want an easy-to-use platform just for their organization.
- Users, with their own unique needs, can freely install the platform wherever they choose.
